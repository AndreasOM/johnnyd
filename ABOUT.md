# About JohnnyD

Johnny D is an experiment.
Actually it's two experiments.

## Experiment One

I have about 1.8 TB of data in my Dropbox folder.
Accumulated over years.
And while they are glimpses of order
mostly they are a mess.

So I am considering sorting them into a system based on https://johnnydecimal.com/

Obviously I won't do that manually,
but write a tool that does the heavy lifting.

## Experiment Two

As probably almost every other software developer on this planet
I have kept a close eye on the state of using AI to generate software;
And I think the time is now.

So I won't write any code myself,
and just tell AI what it should do.

We will start with claude code,
and see how far we get.
